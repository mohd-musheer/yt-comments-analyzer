📘 Project Description

This is a group-based NLP project developed by a team of five members focusing on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using the Sentiment140 dataset. The project applies classical Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning models from scikit-learn to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

The work was collaboratively divided across data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and result analysis, ensuring an efficient and scalable NLP pipeline for large-scale tweet data.
